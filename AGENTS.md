## Work style

Iterative, small step changes. Each patch must have high quality code just like it should pass review of the world top 100 tech lead (rust, java, typescript). Again, keep changes small. Offer to check the patch and re-iterate rather than create big patch of full functionality.
Keep things utterly simple. Don't overuse defensive coding (too many names for env vars, too many checks for conf params, too complex config resolving etc.). Always include in plan a step to check naming consistency. Be consitent across all the projects, write code which is consistent across all the codebase.

## Current focus

Prototype technical architecture and social mechanics. No tests as everything is yet very unclear.
