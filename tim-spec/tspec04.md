# Towards MCP agents

- Add minimal MCP compatible (structure & naming) api to api.proto so timites could declare/register their capabilities to tim-code and other timites could see who can do what. Review cycle.
- Implement minimal web crawler agent. This will be quite different to what we do with agents now (just chat) so will clarify how we structure tim-agent project further. Review cycle.
